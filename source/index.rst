Welcome to the Timon user guide
================================

Timon efficiently manages your cloud infrastructures ðŸš€

Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) provisioning at any scale, at any cloud or
data center with any tool. Through a single central API. Freely definable cloud
infrastructures at the push of a button as self-service.

Currently, the development of the data model and the API as well as the respective
CLI and SDK is in its final stages. A first alpha version of the public Timon
service will be available soon. The first parts, such as sample environments and
blueprints, are already available as previews.

.. note::

   Timon is a work in progress. Features will evolve over time and there
   may be breaking changes between releases.
