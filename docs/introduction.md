# Introduction

The Cloudsphere efficiently manages your cloud infrastructures ðŸš€

Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) provisioning at any scale,
at any cloud or data center with any tool. Through a single central
API. Freely definable cloud infrastructures at the push of a button
as self-service.

## Terminology

![Terminology](terminology.png)

### Environment

An environment contains all the necessary runtime components to
execute Infrastructure as Code contained in a Blueprint.

### Blueprint

A Blueprint contains everything needed to create a cloud infrastructure
in the form of Infrastructure as Code.

### Deployment

A deployment executes an environment in a blueprint with a given
parameterization (template).

### Input

Both blueprints and deployments can be passed any inputs at runtime.
These inputs are assembled in shells and then assigned.

### Log

Individual executions generate logs. For example, a deployment or a reconcilation.
The generated STDOUT and STDERR as well as the exit code are stored in the database.
