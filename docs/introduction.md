# Introduction

**The Cloudsphere** efficiently manages your cloud infrastructures ðŸš€

The Cloudsphere's mission statement is:

> Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) provisioning at any scale,
> at any cloud or data center with any tool. Through a single central
> API. Freely definable cloud infrastructures at the push of a button
> as self-service.

## Overview

![Overview](overview.png "Overview")

### What is The Cloudsphere?

* an attempt to realise a small code base for API, orchestrator and runner
  services (less than 5000 SLOCs)

### What is The Cloudsphere <u>not</u>?

* an alternative to Infrastructure as Code tool X

## Terminology

![Terminology](terminology.png)

### Environment

An environment contains all the necessary runtime components to
execute Infrastructure as Code contained in a Blueprint.

### Blueprint

A Blueprint contains everything needed to create a cloud infrastructure
in the form of Infrastructure as Code.

### Input

Blueprints, environments, and deployments can be passed any inputs at runtime.
These inputs are assembled in templates and then assigned.

### Template

### Deployment

A deployment executes an environment in a blueprint with a given
parameterization (template).

### State

### Log

Individual executions generate logs. For example, a deployment or a reconcilation.
The generated STDOUT and STDERR as well as the exit code are stored in the database.

For example, this is the output of Terraform, which is currently performing a ``DESTROY`` action.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.tcs will be destroyed
  - resource "openstack_compute_secgroup_v2" "tcs" {
      - description = "hello-world security group" -> null
[...]
```
